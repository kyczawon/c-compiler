2017/2018 Compilers Coursework
==============================

## Overview

The coursework was split into 3 techincal aspects below, which test our lexing, parsing and code generation knowledge. More information on each can be found in the releavant .md files.

- [*C-translator*](c_translator.md) (28.6%) : Your compiler will be able to translate a sub-set of C
  into equivalent Python. This allows each submission to demonstrate lexing and
  parsing functionality, even if the code generation is weak.

- [*C-compiler*](c_compiler.md) (42.8%) : This is a compiler from C to MIPS assembly.

- [*Test suite*](c_test_suite.md) (14.3%): Each submission must contain a set of test programs which 
  are able to determine whether a given compiler implements certain C language
  features correctly.
  
- [*a time-tracking/project management component*](management.md) (14.3%): To encourage consisent work
